## End-to-End Retail Analytics & Customer Insights Project

**Margin Optimization through Statistical Customer Segmentation**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project delivers an **end-to-end retail analytics solution** for a highly competitive chips market, with a clear focus on **profit margin optimization**.

Instead of broad, generic promotions, the analysis applies **statistical customer segmentation** to identify the **most price-tolerant and high-value customer group**.
The final output is a **business-ready Power BI dashboard** that enables sales, inventory, and merchandising teams to take **data-backed actions** with confidence.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Retail teams were facing:

* Undifferentiated promotions across all customer segments
* Inefficient inventory allocation
* Premium products being discounted for low-value customers

This resulted in **suboptimal margins** and wasted marketing spend in a price-sensitive market.

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

### 1️⃣ Data Integration & Preparation

* Combined **customer demographics** and **transaction-level sales data**
* Scale: **72,000+ customers** and **2.64 lakh transactions**
* Engineered key metrics such as **Price per Unit** and segment-level KPIs

### 2️⃣ Statistical Validation

* Applied a **Two-Sample T-Test** to compare average price paid across customer segments
* Objective: identify the **most price-tolerant segment** with statistical confidence (p < 0.05)

### 3️⃣ Affinity & Strategy Modeling

* Built a **Brand & Pack Size Affinity Index**
* Identified products and pack sizes that over-index within the target segment
* Converted insights into **clear merchandising and inventory strategies**

---

## 🔍 Key Insight

📈 **Mainstream Young Singles/Couples** emerged as the **most profitable segment**, showing:

* **Highest Average Price Paid:** **$4.07**
* Statistically significant price tolerance compared to other segments
* Strong preference for **premium brands** and **larger pack sizes**

This segment represents the **highest margin opportunity** for the business.
